# EchoMap UX — Shortcut Reference

This document is the source of truth for EchoMap's keyboard / mouse model.
It pairs with goal 012 "industry-grade UX parity" and tracks the equivalents
shipped for Cinema 4D, Blender, and SolidWorks idioms.

## Modes

| Key | Mode |
|---|---|
| `1` | Select |
| `2` | Place Source |
| `3` | Place Listener |
| `Tab` | Toggle fly camera (WASD + right-drag look) |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle tele-op (drives `robot/0` from WASD/QE) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Q` | Toggle quad-view (Top / Front / Side / Perspective) |
| `Esc` | Cancel modal / clear selection |

## Command Palette

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd/Ctrl+K` | Open command palette (fuzzy search across all actions) |
| `↑ / ↓` | Navigate results |
| `Enter` | Run the highlighted action |
| `Esc` | Close palette |

The palette registers 30+ actions across categories: `view:`, `display:`,
`mode:`, `add:`, `edit:`, `sim:`, `robot:`, `misc:`.

## Transform Gizmos (Blender-style modal)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `G` | Translate gizmo |
| `R` | Rotate gizmo (fallback: reset camera if no selection) |
| `S` | Scale gizmo |
| `X / Y / Z` | Constrain to axis (while gizmo active) |
| `Shift` (hold) | Snap during gizmo confirm |
| `0-9 . -` (type) | Numeric type-in for exact delta |
| `Enter` | Apply gizmo |
| `Esc` | Cancel gizmo |

## Selection

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| LMB | Select item under cursor |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+LMB` | Toggle item in multi-select set |
| `Shift+LMB` | Range select (when both endpoints are same category) |
| `A` | Select all (sources + listeners + objects) |
| `Alt+A` | Deselect all |
| `H` | Hide selection |
| `Alt+H` | Unhide all |
| `/` | Toggle isolate mode |
| `B` | Arm box-select (drag-rectangle on next press) |
| `Esc` | Clear selection |

## History / Undo

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` | Undo |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Redo |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Y` | Redo (alternate) |

The history ring buffer is bounded; the status bar surfaces the last
operation with an undo affordance.

## Snap

`Shift` toggles snap mode while moving with a gizmo. The `SnapConfig` field
selects between `Grid` (configurable size, default 0.25 m), `Surface`
(raycast onto mesh), and `Angle` (rotation in 15° increments).

## Camera Views

| Key | View |
|---|---|
| `Num 0` | Perspective |
| `Num 7` | Top |
| `Num 5` | Isometric |
| `[` | Ringside A preset |
| `]` | Ringside B preset |
| `Ctrl+1` | Front |
| `Ctrl+3` | Side |
| `Home` | Frame scene |

Trackpad: pinch zooms via `egui::InputState::zoom_delta()`; two-finger
scroll pans via `smooth_scroll_delta`.

## Outliner

Each row in the outliner panel exposes per-row controls (toggleable
globally via `vp.show_visibility_icons`):

- Eye icon — toggle row visibility
- Lock icon — block accidental click-select
- Locked rows render with `weak()` styling

Multi-row selection routes through the same `SelectionSet` used by viewport
multi-select, so `H` / `/` keys honour outliner-picked items.

## Properties Polish

Numeric DragValue fields accept arithmetic expressions via
`ui::expr::evaluate_expression`. Supported syntax: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`,
unary `±`, parens, scientific notation, constants (`pi`, `e`, `tau`), and
functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `abs`, `sqrt`, `ln`, `log`, `floor`, `ceil`,
`round`). Example: `2*pi`, `sqrt(9)`, `1+sin(0)`.

## Right-Click Context Menus

Right-clicking the viewport opens a selection-aware menu:

- No selection: Add Source / Listener / Partition Wall / Platform · Reset Camera
- Source / Listener / Object: Focus · Delete
- Robot / RobotLink: Focus

## Pie Menu

Hold `Q` to open the radial pie menu at the cursor. Eight wedges (clockwise
from North): Frame Selected → Reset Camera → Toggle Grid → Toggle Shaded →
Top View → Place Source → Place Listener → Run Simulation. Release `Q` on a
wedge to commit; release on the centre dead-zone to cancel.

## Onboarding

A first-run modal walks new users through Load Model → Place Source → Place
Listener → Run Sim → View Results. `F1` reopens the cheat sheet at any time.
The "Don't show again" choice persists across launches.

## Status Bar

The viewport status bar always shows:

- Current mode label (`Select`, `Place Source`, `Place Listener`)
- A `next_step_hint` for the current mode + selection
- Held modifier glyphs (⇧ ⌃ ⌥ ⌘)
- An `action_hint` showing the last history-affecting operation + undo affordance

## Sensible Defaults

- `auto_fit_camera(aabb)` runs after each scene load so models always appear
  in-frame
- Default ambient lighting (Lambert + drop-shadow) on shaded objects
- Numeric inspector fields show units (m, °, kg) next to values
- "Welcome" empty-state hint in the viewport when no scene is loaded

## Performance & Crash-Safety (goal/013)

EchoMap auto-detects device capability at startup and degrades render +
sim work gracefully under load instead of crashing.

### Throttle behaviour

| Class | Trigger (rolling 30-frame avg) | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `perf: healthy` | ≤ 25 ms / frame (≥ 40 fps) | Full quality |
| `perf: degraded` | 25–50 ms / frame (20–40 fps) | ~0.75× sim substeps, ray paths, heatmap resolution |
| `perf: throttled` | > 50 ms / frame (< 20 fps) | ~0.5× everything; nice-to-have effects skipped |

Downshifts are immediate; upshifts wait for `STICKY_FRAMES` (≈60 frames)
of recovery to avoid oscillation. The active class is shown in the
Settings → Performance window and is queryable via
`echomap::renderer::PerfGovernor::class()`.

### Environment overrides

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ECHOMAP_SIM_THREADS` | auto from cores | Cap physics worker count |
| `ECHOMAP_RAY_PATHS` | auto from cores | Default debug ray-path budget |
| `ECHOMAP_HEATMAP_RES` | auto from cores | Surface heatmap resolution |
| `ECHOMAP_STRESS` | unset | `=1` pre-loads 50 listeners + drives crash-injection smoke |
| `ECHOMAP_TEST_FRAMES` | unset | `=N` exits 0 after N frames (CI gate) |

### Crash-injection smoke

`ECHOMAP_TEST_FRAMES=120 ECHOMAP_STRESS=1 cargo run --release --bin echomap`
runs 120 frames with the stress scene. Over-budget frames log + downshift
the governor; the harness only exits 2 if 30 consecutive frames exceed
`TEST_FRAME_BUDGET` (500 ms) without governor recovery.

### Renderer paint budget

`src/renderer/bounds.rs` defines hard caps the painter never crosses:

- `MAX_PAINT_TRIS` = 200 000 — `render_surface_overlay` `take(cap)`s
- `MAX_RAY_LINES` = 100 000 — `render_ray_paths_debug` tracks `lines_emitted`
- `MAX_LISTENER_PULSES` = 4 096

These are absolute ceilings independent of the PerfGovernor — they kick
in when a pathologically large scene would otherwise hang the UI thread
on tessellation.

### Recorder failure modes

`src/teleop/recorder.rs` is fail-soft:

- `Recorder::create` auto-creates the parent directory
- Disk-full / `EACCES` / serialize errors log **once** and set the
  recorder to `RecorderState::Disabled`
- Further `try_record` calls return `Disabled` without touching the
  filesystem; `frames_dropped` counter is visible via `frames_dropped()`
- Drop never panics, even if the file vanished

### Agent harness backpressure

`src/agent/backpressure.rs` provides a soft cap + drop-oldest counter
(`Backpressure::DEFAULT_CAPACITY` = 4096). Lock-free atomic
`dropped_messages` counter is surfaceable in the agent inspector window
so misbehaving clients are visible.

`ws_server::local_port` and `tcp_server::local_port` no longer panic if
the kernel can't report the listener's address — they log and return 0
so the rest of the agent harness keeps running.

### Hot-path unwrap budget

`scripts/check-hot-path-unwraps.sh` enforces a budget of 5 production
`.unwrap()` / `panic!` / `.expect(` occurrences across:

- `src/main.rs`
- `src/teleop/recorder.rs`
- `src/agent/{bridge,ws_server,tcp_server,session}.rs`
- `src/renderer/*.rs`

Test-mode unwraps inside `#[cfg(test)]` blocks are excluded — they're
how `assert!` works. Sites that must panic carry a `// SAFETY:` comment
to opt out of the count.
