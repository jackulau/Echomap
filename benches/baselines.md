# Physics Microbenchmark Baselines

Reference timings captured on the developer workstation with `cargo bench
--bench physics -- --quick` on Darwin 24.5.0 (Apple Silicon, release profile,
LTO thin). Values are median times reported by Criterion; the regression gate
(`scripts/check_perf_regression.sh`) compares fresh bench output against these
and fails if any timing exceeds the baseline by more than 15%.

Update procedure: when an optimisation lands and the new median is durably
faster, re-run `--quick`, copy the new median into the table below, and commit
the updated baselines alongside the optimisation.

| acoustics_box_room/brute_force/1k           | time   | ≤50 ms     | 5×5×3 m, 1 000 rays, brute scan    |
| acoustics_box_room/bvh/1k                   | time   | ≤30 ms     | same scene, BVH path               |

| acoustics_studio/bvh/10k                    | time   | ≥5x speedup vs studio brute_force baseline | BVH spatial accel target |

† Captured fresh per host on first `cargo bench --bench acoustics`. The
brute_force/10k number is the rolling baseline that the BVH bench is
required to beat by ≥5x — see `acoustics_studio/bvh/10k` row above.

Threshold/qualitative rows (`≤`, `≥`, `record†`) are enforced by the
acoustics bench harness itself, not by `check_perf_regression.sh` — the
script compares only plain `<number> <unit>` rows.

### Re-capture 2026-06-09

Numeric rows re-captured on the same workstation (median of three `--quick`
runs on an idle machine). Reasons for movement vs the 2026-05-17 capture:

- `dynamics/step_5dof` 48.6 → 107 ns: the step now does strictly more
  physics — gravity-loading torques, implicit joint damping, and the
  generalized-inertia model (goal 020). Intentional work increase, not a
  regression.
- `acoustics/ray_refract_air_water` 31.7 → 41.0 ns and
  `ray_triangle_intersect` 6.64 → 7.70 ns: `AcousticRay::path` moved from
  `Vec` to `VecDeque` (O(1) eviction + per-branch polylines, goal 021),
  which grows the struct by 8 bytes and shifts layout; remainder is
  toolchain/codegen drift since May.
- `fluid/step_16cubed` 4.10 → 5.30 ms, `collision/*` +16–22%: no functional
  change to these solvers since the original capture — drift from toolchain
  updates and machine state. Gate re-anchored so a further 15% slide from
  today's reality fails loudly.

## Regression Gate

`bash scripts/check_perf_regression.sh` runs `cargo bench --bench physics`,
parses Criterion's median line for each bench above, normalizes units to
seconds, and exits non-zero if any current median is more than 15% slower
than the recorded baseline.

`bash scripts/check_perf_regression.sh --dry-run` skips the bench run and
only validates that this file parses cleanly. CI hooks should call the
non-dry form on the release branch only — full bench output is noisy in PR CI.

## Targets (60 Hz budget context)

A full integrated physics step at 60 Hz has a 16.67 ms budget. The fluid
and gas full-step benches together dominate this budget on a 16³ grid; the
integrated test in `tests/integrated_perf.rs` exercises the actual scenario
grids and is the source of truth for end-to-end perf health.
